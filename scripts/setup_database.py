üèóÔ∏è DATABASE SETUP - Building Our Crime Data Foundation
======================================================

This script is like the "construction crew" for our dashboard. It builds
the foundation that everything else depends on - our crime database.

What this script does:
1. Creates a SQLite database file on your computer
2. Sets up tables to store crime incidents and neighborhood information
3. Generates 5,000+ realistic crime records spanning 24 months
4. Includes seasonal patterns (more crime in summer, less in winter)
5. Creates neighborhood-specific characteristics (Downtown has different patterns than suburbs)

Think of this as creating a realistic "practice dataset" that mimics what
real Toronto crime data might look like. This lets us build and test our
dashboard without needing access to actual police databases.

WHY WE NEED THIS:
- Real crime databases are restricted and not publicly accessible
- We need realistic data to test our dashboard features
- Sample data lets us demonstrate seasonal patterns and trends
- It provides a safe environment to learn and experiment

Purpose: Create a realistic crime database for dashboard development and learning
