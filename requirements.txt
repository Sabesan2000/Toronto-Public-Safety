# 📦 PYTHON PACKAGE REQUIREMENTS
# ===============================
# 
# This file tells Python which external libraries our dashboard needs to work.
# Think of it like a shopping list for software - it ensures everyone who
# runs our dashboard has exactly the same tools installed.
# 
# WHY THIS MATTERS:
# - Different versions of libraries can behave differently
# - This file ensures consistency across different computers
# - Makes it easy for others to set up the exact same environment
# - Prevents "it works on my machine" problems
# 
# TO INSTALL THESE PACKAGES:
# Run this command in your terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt
